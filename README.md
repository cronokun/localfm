# LOCAL.FM

Last.fm analog for capturing and displaying playback history statistics from my
local MoodeAudio setup.

## How It Works

Script copies playback log from MoodeAudio, converts it to CSV, calculate simple
statistics (top 10 artists, albums and track for last 30 days) and generates
simple static HTML file.
